# Actor Base 
Basic framework for a Fabric Control Framework Actor

## Overview
A basic fabric actor would have following capabilities:
  - Exposes REST API
  - Plugin Manager to load the required plugins by using [Yapsy Plugin System](http://yapsy.sourceforge.net/)

This actor was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## API
API Documentation can be found [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/kthare10/actorbase/1.0.0#/)

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m swagger_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/fabric/actorbase/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/fabric/actorbase/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t swagger_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 swagger_server

# bring using via docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```

## Generate a new server stub
In a browser, go to [Swagger definition](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/kthare10/actorbase/1.0.0)

From the generate code icon (downward facing arrow), select Download API > JSON Resolved

A file named swagger-client-generated.zip should be downloaded. This file will contain swagger.json. Extract the json file from the swagger-client-generated.zip and run the following command to generate the Flask based server.

```bash
$ swagger-codegen generate -i swagger.json -l python-flask -o actorbase
```

## Example
The following example invokes a create slice operation and depicts create slice function of the Controller plugin being executed:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -i "localhost:8080/fabric/actorbase/create?resourceID=abcd-5678" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: text/plain"  -d @test.txt
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 31
Server: Werkzeug/0.16.0 Python/3.6.10
Date: Wed, 22 Jan 2020 16:26:02 GMT

"IActorPlugin: creating slice"
```

## Plugins
The actor loads all the plugins in "plugins" directory. Each plugin must inherit from IActorPlugin class and have an info file. The following is an example for controller plugin. For implementation details look at controller.py. Small set of Base classes or the interfaces are defined in "plugins/api" directory (more stuff to be added). 
```bash
$ ls plugins/controller/
controller.py		controller.yapsy-plugin

$ cat plugins/controller/controller.yapsy-plugin
[Core]
Name = controller
Module = controller
