# Orchestrator
The Orchestrator component is responsible for mapping the resources requested by an experimenter onto appropriate FABRIC resources (i.e., experiment or measurement resources).  The Orchestrator component learns about potential resources in FABRIC from one or more Brokers.

It exposes a North Bound user facing REST APIs to allow user to send their provisioning requests. It talks to Broker and AMs via Kafka based Message Bus.

## North Bound REST Interface
This is implemented as Swagger based REST Server. This swagger server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

Orchestrator uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

### API
API Documentation can be found [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/kthare10/orchestrator/1.0.0)

### Swagger Server
The swagger server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  

Orchestrator uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

### Generate a new server stub
In a browser, go to [Swagger definition](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/kthare10/credmgr/1.0.0-oas3)

From the generate code icon (downward facing arrow), select Download API > JSON Resolved

A file named kthare10-orchestrator-1.0.0-resolved.json should be downloaded. Rename it as openapi.json and copy it to ActorBase/fabric/orchestrator. Run the following command to generate the Flask based server.

```bash
$ cp kthare10-orchestrator-1.0.0-resolved.json openapi.json
$ ./update_swagger_stub.sh
```
Remove existing swagger_server directory and move my_server/swagger_server to swagger_server after verifying all changes are as expected.

## Configuration
`config.site.orchestrator.yaml` depicts an example config file for an Orchestrator.

## Deployment
Orchestrator must deploy following containers:
- Neo4j
- Postgres Database
- Policy Enforcement Function (TBD)
- Broker

`docker-compose.yml` file present in this directory brings up all the required containers

### Environment and Configuration

Your Project must be configured prior to running it for the first time. Example configuration files have been provided as templates to start from.

Do not check any of your configuration files into a repository as they will contain your projects secrets (use .gitignore to exclude any files containing secrets).

1. .env from [env.template](env.template) - Environment variables for `docker-compose.yml` to use

#### .env
A file named `env.template` has been provided as an example, and is used by the `docker-compose.yml` file.
```
cp env.template .env
```
Once copied, modify the default values for each to correspond to your desired deployment. The UID and GID based entries should correspond to the values of the user responsible for running the code as these will relate to shared volumes from the host to the running containers.
```
# docker-compose environment file
#
# When you set the same environment variable in multiple files,
# hereâ€™s the priority used by Compose to choose which value to use:
#
#  1. Compose file
#  2. Shell environment variables
#  3. Environment file
#  4. Dockerfile
#  5. Variable is not defined

# Neo4J configuration

```
### Build
Once all configuration has been done, the user can build the necessary containers by issuing:
```
docker-compose build
```
### Run
#### database
Create the database directories if they do not exist
```
mkdir -p pg_data/data pg_data/logs

```
Start the pre-defined PostgreSQL database in Docker
```
docker-compose up -d database
```
Validate that the database container is running.
```
$ docker-compose ps
  Name                Command              State           Ports
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
orchestrator-db   docker-entrypoint.sh postgres   Up      0.0.0.0:10432->5432/tcpdocker-compose ps
```
#### neo4j
Create the neo4j directories if they do not exist
```
mkdir -p neo4j/data neo4j/imports neo4j/logs
echo password > neo4j/password
```
Start the pre-defined Neo4j database in Docker
```
docker-compose up -d neo4j
```
Validate that the database container is running.
```
docker-compose ps
    Name                  Command                 State                                                     Ports

```
#### am
Update `docker-compose.yml` to point to correct volumes for the Broker.

```
    volumes:
      - ./neo4j:/usr/src/app/neo4j
      - ./config.orchestrator.yaml:/etc/fabric/actor/config/config.yaml
      - ./logs/:/var/log/actor
      - ../../secrets/snakeoil-ca-1.crt:/etc/fabric/message_bus/ssl/cacert.pem
      - ../../secrets/kafkacat1.client.key:/etc/fabric/message_bus/ssl/client.key
