# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

Orchestrator uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
python3 -m swagger_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080//ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080//swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Generate a new server stub
In a browser, go to [Swagger definition](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/kthare10/credmgr/1.0.0-oas3)

From the generate code icon (downward facing arrow), select Download API > JSON Resolved

A file named kthare10-orchestrator-1.0.0-resolved.json should be downloaded. Rename it as openapi.json and copy it to ActorBase/fabric/orchestrator. Run the following command to generate the Flask based server.

```bash
$ cp kthare10-orchestrator-1.0.0-resolved.json openapi.json
$ ./update_swagger_stub.sh
```
Remove existing swagger_server directory and move my_server/swagger_server to swagger_server after verifying all changes are as expected.
