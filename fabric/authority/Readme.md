# Aggregate Manager
An aggregate manager controls access to the substrate components. It controls some set of infrastructure resources in a particular site consisting of a set of servers, storage units, network elements or other components under common ownership and control. AMs inform brokers about available resources by passing to the resource advertisement information models. AMs may be associated with more than one broker and the partitioning of resources between brokers is the decision left to the AM. Oversubscription is possible, depending on the deployment needs.
FABRIC enables a substrate provider to outsource resource arbitration and calendar scheduling to a broker. By delegating resources to the broker, the AM consents to the brokerâ€™s policies, and agrees to try to honor reservations issued by the broker if the user has authorization on the AM. 

Besides common code, each AM type has specific plugins that determine its resource allocation behavior (Resource Management Policy) and the specific actions it takes to provision a sliver (Resource Handler). Both plugins are invoked by AM common core code based on the resource type or type of request being considered.
